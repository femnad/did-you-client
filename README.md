did-you-client
==============

Client for the distributed task nagger, `did-you`.

How?
----

    $ did_you_client list
    $ did_you_client do stuff
    Got response: Ack
    $ did_you_client list
    stuff
    $ did_you_client done stuff
    Got response: Ack
    $ did_you_client list

... do you expect me mark multiple word items as done?

That has got to be the worst lampshading ever.
